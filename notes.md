# Car Horn Research Notes

## Regulations

### UNECE Regulation 28 (Europe, widely adopted)
- Sound pressure: 105-118 dB(A) at 2 meters
- Alternative: 93-113 dB at 7 meters
- Frequency: effective acoustic energy in 1500-3550 Hz range

### United States (FMVSS 571.101)
- NHTSA does not require a horn on motor vehicles
- If horn is provided: must be operable by driver, identified per standard
- No frequency mandate

### Historical convention
- Larger vehicles = lower pitch horns
- VW Beetles: high-pitched "beep-beep"
- Cadillacs: low "French horn" sound
- Rationale: pitch signals vehicle size to pedestrians

## Horn Frequencies

### Typical frequencies
- Standard: ~440 Hz (A4, concert pitch)
- Dual horn pairs: 500 Hz + 405-420 Hz (B4 + G#4, minor third)
- Cheaper alternatives: 420-440 Hz + 340-370 Hz
- Trucks/buses: 125-180 Hz (much lower)

### Why pairs?
- Two different frequencies more perceptible than single tone in noisy environments
- Creates a chord (minor or major third)
- Doubles perceived loudness

### Design variables
- Diaphragm flexibility and mass
- Electromagnet power
- Case shape and size
- Spring loading of contacts

## Economics of Noise

### NBER Paper: "The Traffic Noise Externality"
- Authors: Currie, Davis, Greenstone, Walker
- Link: https://www.nber.org/papers/w34298
- Aggregate cost: $110 billion nationwide (US)
- Property values: 0.4-1.1% decline per decibel
- Noise barrier construction: 6.8% price increase within 100m
- Pigovian tax: $974 per vehicle one-time fee
- EVs: $77.3 billion in noise reduction benefits
- Distribution: regressive (low-income/minority bear more burden)

## Psychoacoustics

### Consonance vs Dissonance
- Dissonance: "roughness" or "beating" when frequencies are close
- Critical band: as wide as minor third (low freq) to minor second (high freq)
- Minor thirds are consonant (perceived as pleasant)
- Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45812-z

### Universal vs Cultural
- Aversion to roughness appears universal
- Papua New Guinea study: negative relationship between roughness and stability
- Automatic aversion not governed by cultural familiarity

### Emotional effects
- Dissonance induces negative affect, anger-irritation, disgust
- Higher physiological responses to dissonant music

## Game Theory Angle

### Current equilibrium
- Each manufacturer optimizes individually for "noticeable but not annoying"
- No coordination on pitch across brands

### Social optimum
- Coordinated pitch assignments for consonance when multiple cars honk
- Analogy: radio spectrum allocation, musical tuning standards (A=440 Hz)

### Counterargument
- Pitch differentiation = safety signal (identifies vehicle size)
- Random pitches may actually be better for attention-getting
